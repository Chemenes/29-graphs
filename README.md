## Submission Instructions
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork called `lab-29`
  * Submit a pull request to your repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Set up Travis CI and update your repo to utilize the [Travis CI Github app](https://github.com/marketplace/travis-ci). *Use the free instsallation.*
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on Canvas  

## Requirements  
#### Configuration  
* Structure your Graphs lab similar to how lecture code is scaffolded. Refer to the [backend lab scaffold template](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-javascript-401d25/tree/master/00-BACKEND-lab-scaffold-template).

#### Feature Tasks 
* Implemenent a breadth-first traversal of a graph. 
* Review the provided code for Djikstra's algorithm and comment each line of code on what it's doing. If you need to research other articles to understand Djikstra's algorithm, **please cite those articles with links in your comments**. 

#### Tests
* Write three test assertions for your breadth-first traversal 
 

#### Documentation  
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README (even if your build is failing), and describe what a graph is. Include the Big Oh time and space complexity of your breadth-first traversal. 

#### Stretch Goals
* Implemenent a graph as an edge list. 
* Implement a graph as an adjacency matrix.
